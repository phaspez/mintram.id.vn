### my suck ass college experience

i was young and stupid, i thought that it would be fun, grow up kind of thing. you leave
your hometown to a new city, make meaningful connections, felling fulfilled in education and 
career success. and here i am, finishing third year feeling like a slog. a waste of time. sure, i 
learned a thing or two, and made some connections, but that could have been youtube and chatgpt along
the way, it does the teaching much faster and cheaper than any college will be. and it's like it's
just me talking to myself most of the time. i dont really like group projects where i either take 
all the credits or not interested, or being left out. three years ago i probably had this mix of 
curiosity, ambition and endless energy, now im mentally checked out and counting down the days.

### two most important thing in life is time and money. ive wasted both

#### i'd better sleep than doing this

none of the subjects really interested me and i feel so burned out. dont get me wrong, they're cool, important and
all. operating system concepts, security, computer network, discrete mathematics, graph theory, etc. but they're 
presented in such a dry, higher-class kind of knowledge. literally i just clock in the class
for attendance like at work, then just waltz out as soon as the bell rings. imagine using months of your check
to pay for someone to read powerpoint slides to you and they're not even very good and designing it,
and you just sit there squeezed in a cramped room with 40 something people, bored out of your mind. i dont even know.

#### corporate speak at its finest 

tuition fee is already nearly *doubled* since my first semester. and i am on my last year. seriously what the fuck. because the government no longer
subsidizing public schools anymore and it comes with corporate speak like "achieving independent finance"
that tries to dress up a funding cut as some kind of achievement, then my school just finished a very fancy 
building as i enrolled, haven't got the chance to even set foot in it and now i guess i have to pay for that. 

corporates are really stress-testing 
the public with the most bullshit kind of action imaginable and see if the public can take it. android getting more hostile with
indie developers is a thing, with stricter dev program and no longer allow sideloading in 2026. 

#### the job market and my life choices are equally terrible

with all these AI tools popping up everywhere i just dont think the gap between junior and senior dev roles
will be much wider. people dont even think anymore, just "hey chat gee pee tee summary this report for me plz" 
and copies everything over, i like when it does the math for me and doing really good at autocorrecting my 
mistakes. i dont think i can compete with that.

### disclaimer

of course this is just my hot take. i cant say for sure if yours will be bloom or doom. i just want to 
dump this out loud i dont lose my mind over it. just me mindful over the glamorous media doesnt reflect
the truth nature of it.

or i guess im just a very insecure, hard to reach out, introvert, stuck in a room, needy kind of person who get so burned out 
of my bullshit idk. get a proper boring job, survive and don't die until 70 something, will that gonna 
be the rest of my life now.
