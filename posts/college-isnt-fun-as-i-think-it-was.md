title says it all.

i was young and stupid, i think that it should be fun, grow up kind of activities. you leave
your hometown to a new city, make meaningful connections, felling fulfilled in education and 
career success. and here i am finishing third year feeling like a slog. a waste of time. sure, i 
learned a thing or two, and make some connections, but that could have been youtube and chatgpt along
the way, it does the teaching much faster and cheaper than any college will be. and it's like it's
just me talking to myself most of the time. 

tuition fee is already doubled since i my first semester. i dont make friends that much in college and
most of the time i just spend on the dorm anyway.

or i guess im just a very insecure, hard to reach out, introvert, needy person who get so burned out 
of my bullshit idk. get a proper job, survive and don't die until 70 something, will that gonna 
be the rest of my life now.
