so uhh in this guide i will try to make it as simple as possible with code examples.

![](/images/leaderboard/leaderboard.png)

this is the approach that i used for the game [Makeshift](https://phaspez.itch.io/makeshift)

##### prerequisites

you should have some basic experience with SQL databases (what is a table? primary key? basic data types?), especially Postgres,
HTTP requests (what is CRUD? HTTP request methods?), and Godot (what is a signal? binding a func to a signal?).

## setting up your Supabase instance

### create an account and a table

it's free for small usage or if you just want to test things out! it's simply a Postgres database where when you create tables,
it automatically creates API endpoints for them.

- register an account
- create a new project
- choose a database password or generate one
- select the server region, choose any data center you'd like, closest to you or where the majority of users are
- skip security options and advanced config for now, or customize however you'd like

![](/images/leaderboard/create_new.png)

now you'd have to create a leaderboard table, with at least a unique user ID and a score. in my game, i have
an `id`, `last_submit`, `user_name`, and `score` column with datatypes of `uuid`, `timestamptz`,
`varchar` and `float4` respectively. be careful that your table name is case-sensitive; in my case i named it Leaderboard. this
is important later on.

`id` and `last_submit` won't have a default value since they will be created in the game client
and then sent back. just simply clear them for now.

### update RLS policies

Row Level Security policy means you can control what types of users can edit or view your tables. in the Table Editor, there's your table in each tab. and there's also a 'RLS policies' button on your table tab. create three policies:
enable Insert, Select and Update for everyone. you can set target roles to either anon or public; anon users require an
auth key to access it, which i'll be using later on.

![](/images/leaderboard/rls.png)

in the WITH CHECK clause, just put `true` for now, you don't need to validate anything yet.

### getting your API keys and HTTP endpoint

final step! just head over Settings > API Keys > Legacy anon and copy the key, save it for later. anon keys are safe to use
in the client.

![](/images/leaderboard/anon.png)

your API endpoint is found at Settings > Data API.

## in your Godot game

### making a Supabase wrapper node

now this is where it gets complicated. if you want to release the game in the browser, there's this very
annoying CORS policy that blocks requests when it's used on the browser, which would work normally if you just
use a native app. the HTTPRequest node in Godot has this restriction.

in order to bypass it, you have to use HTTPClient, which is a low level native socket. this makes the
code a lot more bloated. i have no idea why HTTPClient works and HTTPRequest doesn't on my machine :(

create a new script called supabase.gd, then paste this in, replace the const strings with your actual values:

```gdscript
class_name Supabase extends Node

const SUPABASE_URL: String = "https://YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
const SUPABASE_HOST: String = "YOUR_SUPABASE_URL_WITHOUT_HTTP_PART"
const SUPABASE_KEY: String = "YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"

signal leaderboard_fetched(leaderboard_data: Array)
signal score_submitted()


func get_leaderboard() -> void:
    print("Fetching leaderboard...")
    _fetch_leaderboard_async()


func submit_score(player_uuid: String, score: float, player_name: String) -> void:
    print("Submitting score: %f for player: %s" % [score, player_uuid])

    var body := {
        "id": player_uuid,
        "score": score,
        "last_submit": get_postgres_timestamp_utc(),
        "user_name": player_name
    }

    var json_body := JSON.stringify(body)
    _submit_score_async(json_body)


func _fetch_leaderboard_async() -> void:
    var http = HTTPClient.new()
    var err = http.connect_to_host(SUPABASE_HOST, 443, TLSOptions.client())

    if err != OK:
        print("Failed to connect: ", err)
        leaderboard_fetched.emit([])
        return

    # Wait for connection
    while http.get_status() == HTTPClient.STATUS_CONNECTING or http.get_status() == HTTPClient.STATUS_RESOLVING:
        http.poll()
        await get_tree().process_frame

    ]

    if err != OK:
        print("Request failed: ", err)
        leaderboard_fetched.emit([])

        leaderboard_fetched.emit([])
        return

    # Check response code
    if http.get_response_code() != 200:
        print("HTTP Request failed with response code: ", http.get_response_code())
        leaderboard_fetched.emit([])
        return

    # Read response body
    var body = PackedByteArray()
    while http.get_status() == HTTPClient.STATUS_BODY:
        http.poll()
        var chunk = http.read_response_body_chunk()
        if chunk.size() == 0:
            await get_tree().process_frame
        else:
            body += chunk

    var parse = JSON.parse_string(body.get_string_from_utf8())
    leaderboard_fetched.emit(parse)


func _submit_score_async(json_body: String) -> void:
    var http = HTTPClient.new()
    var err = http.connect_to_host(SUPABASE_HOST, 443, TLSOptions.client())

    if err != OK:
        print("Failed to connect: ", err)
        return

    # Wait for connection
    while http.get_status() == HTTPClient.STATUS_CONNECTING or http.get_status() == HTTPClient.STATUS_RESOLVING:
        http.poll()
        await get_tree().process_frame

        return

    # Make request

        "Content-Type: application/json",
        "Accept: application/json",
        "Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates"
    ]

    err = http.request(HTTPClient.METHOD_POST, "/rest/v1/Leaderboard", headers, json_body)

    if err != OK:
        print("Request failed: ", err)
        return

    if response_code in [200, 201]:
        print("Score submitted successfully.")
        score_submitted.emit()
    else:
        var parse = JSON.parse_string(body.get_string_from_utf8())
        print("Response: ", parse)
        print("Failed to submit score. Response code: %d" % response_code)


static func get_postgres_timestamp_utc() -> String:
    return Time.get_datetime_string_from_system(true, false) + "Z"

static func convert_utc_string_to_local(utc_string: String) -> String:
    var unix_time = Time.get_unix_time_from_datetime_string(utc_string)

    var timezone = Time.get_time_zone_from_system()
    var bias_minutes = timezone["bias"]
    var local_unix_time = unix_time + (bias_minutes * 60)

    return Time.get_datetime_string_from_unix_time(local_unix_time, true)

```

that's lengthy! here's the summary:

- the `get_leaderboard` calls `_fetch_leaderboard_async`, which creates a new request, assembles the request header,
  actually makes the request, parses the body, then fires a signal that contains an array of dictionaries. you can then
  use that to display the data in the game.
- the `submit_score` takes in player UUID, score, and name. it assembles the request body then passes it to
  `_submit_score_async` which is similar to the above async function.
- `get_postgres_timestamp_utc` creates a timestamptz string for postgres.
- `convert_utc_string_to_local` converts the string from the above function to your local machine's timezone.
- when making requests, `?order=score.desc` means order by the score column in descending order. you can also sort multiple
  columns, just replace it with something like `?order=score.desc,last_submit.desc`
- `Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates` is a header that tells Supabase how to handle conflict when inserting data. in this case
  if you submit with an existing `id`, instead of throwing an error, it updates the existing row. this is called an upsert (update + insert).
  without it, submitting the same id twice would fail.

you just need to call `get_leaderboard` and `submit_score`, then connect the signal somewhere that responds to these events.

if you dont need to deal with time, just remove anything related to those, like those two static functions and the timestamp in the request body.

remember that tables are case sensitive, in my case i have Leaderboard capitalized, so the endpoint is `/rest/v1/Leaderboard`;
replace it with your own name.

### create a unique player ID

you'd need to create the player's ID and save it in your game save file. here's a script to generate a random UUID. the chance of
a collision is astronomically tiny so you likely won't need to worry about it. just paste the file somewhere in your
project, call `UUID.uuid4()` and you have a unique ID! it's just a static function that returns a unique string. just to be extra careful, please call `randomize()` somewhere before this to change the seed.

in case you need to know how to save files in Godot, follow the [Saving games](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/io/saving_games.html) doc.

```gdscript
### uuid.gd
class_name UUID

const uuid_chars = "0123456789abcdef"
static func uuid4() -> String:
    var result := ""
    for i in range(32):
        if i in [8, 12, 16, 20]: result += "-"
        if i == 12: result += "4"
        elif i == 16:
            var r := randi() % 16
            r = (r & 0x3) | 0x8 # variant bits
            result += uuid_chars[r]
        else:
            var r := randi() % 16
            result += uuid_chars[r]
    return result
```

if you have an existing save file, i guess updating it is relatively simple too. here's how mine works:

```gdscript
func load_or_create_player_data() -> PlayerData:
    if ResourceLoader.exists(SAVE_FILE_PATH):
        var data = ResourceLoader.load(SAVE_FILE_PATH)
        if data is PlayerData:
            if data.player_uuid == "" or data.player_uuid == null:
                data.player_uuid = UUID.uuid4()
                print("Fixed missing UUID in existing save: %s" % data.player_uuid)
                player_data = data
                save_player_data() # Save the fix
            return data

    print("No save file found. Creating new profile...")
    var new_data = PlayerData.new()
    new_data.player_uuid = UUID.uuid4()

    player_data = new_data

    save_player_data()
    print("Created and Saved new Player UUID: %s" % new_data.player_uuid)
    return new_data
```

it simply checks if the save file exists, loads that, then checks inside it whether a UUID exists or not. if not, it creates one then saves.

### display and submit the score

you already have a signal that emits an Array of Dictionaries, just connect it somewhere to use it. you can have multiple Supabase nodes anywhere if you like.

```gdscript
### leaderboard_list.gd
...
func _on_leaderboard_fetched(leaderboard_data: Array) -> void:
    var rank: int = 1
    for entry in leaderboard_data:
        print("entry is: ", entry)
        var entry_instance: LeaderboardEntry = LEADERBOARD_ENTRY.instantiate()
        entries_container.add_child(entry_instance)
        var hsep := HSeparator.new()
        entries_container.add_child(hsep)

        entry_instance.setup(
            rank, entry.get("user_name", "Unknown"), entry.get("last_submit", "Unknown"),
            str(entry.get("score", "0.0")), entry.get("id", "")
        )

        rank += 1
    leaderboard_refreshed.emit()


## in your ui script:
supabase.leaderboard_fetched.connect(_on_leaderboard_fetched)
```

in my case, for each item, i create a custom `LeaderboardEntry` node, which is an individual line that displays it.

```gdscript
### leaderboard_entry.gd
...
func setup(rank: int, username_text: String, time_text: String, score_value: String, user_uuid: String) -> void:
    username.text = username_text
    score.text = score_value
    time.text = Supabase.convert_utc_string_to_local(time_text)
    rank_label.text = str(rank)

    if user_uuid == GameManager.player_data.player_uuid:
        highlight.visible = true
        rank_label.add_theme_color_override("font_color", Color.BLACK)
```

the `setup` function simply displays them using local time.

```gdscript
### leaderboard.gd
...
func _on_submit_pressed() -> void:
    var username: String = username_line_edit.text.strip_edges()
    if username == "":
        username = "Anonymous"

    supabase.submit_score(GameManager.player_data.player_uuid, total_score, username)
    submit_button.disabled = true
    username_line_edit.editable = false

    await supabase.score_submitted
    leaderboard.refresh_leaderboard()
```

this is how i did the submit. `username_line_edit` is a LineEdit that takes the username, and that's it! you have a simple
leaderboard!

## what's next

there's a lot of things i stripped out. for example, validating your username—what if they type in an empty string? what if the hi-score
is zero? what if they use profanity?

there are a lot of edge cases like these, but to be honest for a simple web game it shouldn't matter that much. the main thing you
should do is focus on your game.

you can also do all sort of cloud saving and online services with it too! it's basically like a website with CRUD functionality
now that i think about it.

thanks for scrolling all the way to this, good luck!
