# bullshit coming up

all right, so kicking off new year with a head start, i got kicked out of GH Pro Education plan, even though i'm technically still
in college (i will graduate this fall). which mean the code repo for this website is now public so i can use GHPages again, how cool!

it even showed me that my status expires within hours, like a bomb that's about to explode

was checking my sites this evening and it threw 404 error, so there was that, i though GH is down again, untill it was not.

i was even considering migrate the site to Netlify again. but then i gave the repo to it and this happened:

what the fuck man. i just want to have a simple and cool site of my own. does it have to be this difficult to deal with all these PaSS
bullshit? so some servers were down. cloudflare was down. then React had a vunerability. and whatever comes next.

you know i thought i was smart using Next because it's bleeding edge, trendy, sexy, until i realized, maintaining it was a pain in the ass.
so still GHPages it is then.
